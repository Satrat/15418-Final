## Project Proposal

### Summary
Currently, the Microsoft HoloLens spatializes sound based only on position relative to the source of the sound. We will raytrace sounds in real space using the Microsoft HoloLens' wall detection to create physically accurate audio.
### Background

### The Challenge
The graphics card on the HoloLens, referred to as the Holographic Processing Unit (HPU), is proprietary and not easy to interact with directly. Additionally, parallel raytracing is too computationally expensive to include in real time rendering. We will need to make the algorithm run fast enough to keep the hololens operating in real time.
