## Project Proposal

### Summary

### Background
Currently, the Microsoft HoloLens utilizes spatial audio to create the illusion that sounds are coming from particular places in the augmented reality environment. However, the HoloLens does not take into account any properties of the room during audio processing. The size and shape of a room can significantly influence sound, and taking these parameters into consideration can improve imersion in an augmented reality environment. 

Our plan is to develop a parallel ray tracing algorithm on the HoloLens GPU, and use it to trace sounds in the augmented reality environment in real time. The HoloLens is already capable of detecting walls in the room by detecting planes, and we will use this information to model size and shape of the room the user is currently in.
